# DSC FULAFIA CHALLENGE

## Genotype matcher

This project should be able to handle matching of genotype for couples before they get wed. This project was proposed due to the issues faced after marriage when couples give birth to children having Sickle cells. The project should be able to get genotype of both parners and then give advice of whether or not they should proceed to get married.

You are adviced to checkout how genotype matching is done before you proceed with the project. 

The project may not necessarily use any form of storage or database.  
Be creative and have fun..!!
