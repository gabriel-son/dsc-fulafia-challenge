# DSC FULAFIA CHALLENGE

## Typing speed
 
After designing this web project, it should be able to test typing speed of a user.  
It will  be more like a game having three categories (Beginner, Intermedite and Advanced). All stages are to have timers and characters the user should type within that time. It must not necessarily be english words, random characters should do. Each category should have something distinct to make it harder than the previous. Advanced stage can be set to have less timing and include special characters to be typed. 

You are adviced to make reserch on JavaScript functions that will eneable you carry out this project. The interface will be designed using HTML and CSS. You will then use JavaScript to collect the input from the user. 

The project may not necessarily use any form of storage or database.  
Be creative and have fun..!!
